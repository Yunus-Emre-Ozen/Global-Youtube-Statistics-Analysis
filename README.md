# Global-Youtube-Statistics-Analysis
I use dataset from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-youtube-statistics-2023" to analyze YouTube statistics to create insight about number of channels for each country and category and
examine their income. In that project, I use seaborn, pandas library. In general I clean and analyze data with pandas library and I use seaborn library to do data visualization. Please help me to improve my code. 

Thank You
